REFI_Textures:

A 16px texture pack.  
These textures were created from scratch in an attempt to recapture the aesthetic of Minecraft, while improving upon visibility.  
This version is fully usable in Minetest Game, MineClone2 up to v0.80, and more.

**Project Status:** Active - Further updates are in development.
