REFI_Textures:
------------------------------

A 16px texture pack.  
These textures were created from scratch in an attempt to recapture the aesthetic of Minecraft, while improving upon visibility.  
This version is fully usable in Minetest Game v5.x, MineClone2 up to 0.71.*, and more.

**Project Status:** Inactive - Further updates temporarily paused.

-- Newer versions of MineClone 2 and/or any forks of MCL2; may be partially supported.  
-- There are also a few alternate textures scattered about; they can be found by searching for filenames with "_alt" in them.
