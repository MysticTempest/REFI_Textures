Alternate Textures Notes:
------------------------------

While I've always had a few alternate textures scattered through the pack; labeled under "_alt". 
I'm consolidating them into a single folder, and adding a very, simple script to automate the overwriting of files.


By default, everything is commented out. This allows you to easily uncomment specific sub-sections, and save the script for re-use in future updates/installs.
Sections separated by "=" are for un-related changes. While sub-sections separated by "-" are for, individual, but related changes.

As an example, netherrack & netherbricks:
They're all in their own section; as they're related nodes.

But, they're still separated by their individual changes.
Netherrack, Nether Brick nodes, and Red Nether Brick nodes.
